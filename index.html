      Nowadays people like to have landing pages.  That’s usually useful. However in the case of some one who is still hashing out her public branding, yet wants to bear some kind of presence on the Internet (also, I'd already paid for the domain name at the time of this #rebrand), it's really only marginally beneficial. Consider this a long-winded stake in the ground with a dangling sign that reads "Under Renovation". I used to have a wealth of *things* displayed online, like my old paintings (I still fantasize about an alternate universe where I am a contemporary oil painter), photos/video stills from an aggressive stint following Araba Ankuma and Emily Lipson around with a Canon DSLR, some documentation of projects like The Locust Experiment, The Collctve, and a startup I co-founded called VINCI VR. Some quick fact in the meantime: studied Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, co-founded a VR startup, experience as a SWE intern at Wealthfront and APM intern at Trello@Atlassian, enjoys yoga, dance, and plants. I'll be returning to Atlassian as an APM in 2020. Otherwise, currently working on tying this all together into a narrative you'd find satisfying.
